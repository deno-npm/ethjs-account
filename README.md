A simple Ethereum account utility module.

Warning: if using with React Native, please use a pre-build distribution (i.e. npm run buld -> /dist/..). We will be switching to the Sepcc256k1 module which should resolve this issue.

## Usage

```js
import { generate } from 'https://deno.land/x/npm_ethjs_account@0.1.5/mod.js';

console.log(generate('892h@fsdf11ks8sk^2h8s8shfs.jk39hsoi@hohskd'));

/* result
{
  address: '0x...',
  privateKey: '0x...',
  publicKey: '0x....',
}
*/
```

Note, the address exported is the mix case checksum.

## About

This module is meant to aid in the management and generation of Ethereum account keys. It is still pending review. Entropy generation is handled by a combination of sha3 hashing, crypto random bytes and provided entropy salt. It is up the developer to ensure good entropy is generated for the accounts.

This module contains methods to convert private keys into Buffer public keys, and Buffer public keys into Ethereum addresses. The sha3 method is exposed as it is needed for key generation.

See the `user-guide` for more details on good entropy generation, and other module information.
